JQuery plugin / Text effects

This is a plugin for JQuery that allows you to perform different transformations on the text:
- automatically scale the text depending on the screen size of the user;
- adaptive scale by width one-line inscription;
- adaptive to fill in a text container;
- create a vertical (rotate 90 degrees) of the label.

I am currently preparing material for publication (usage examples and a detailed description of the parameters)
